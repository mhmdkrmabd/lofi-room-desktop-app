## ✨ Features

- **24/7 Lofi Music Stream** - Enjoy an endless stream of hundreds of high-quality lofi beats, curated and created for the [Lofi Room YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@Just-Lofi-Room). Each track is carefully selected to maintain that perfect study/work vibe.

- **Anime Visuals** - Bring your lofi experience to life with dynamic anime GIFs that perfectly complement the common lofi mood and atmosphere.

- **Adaptive Colors** - The UI automatically extracts and adapts colors from the current anime image, creating a seamless and pleasant visual experience that flows with the music.

- **Ambient Sounds** - Choose from tens of carefully selected ambient sounds embedded within the app. As a lofi listener myself, I know how important the right background atmosphere is for focus and relaxation.

- **Complete Control** - Fine-tune your perfect soundscape with volume control for the music stream, individual volume controls for each ambient sound, and a master volume control for all sounds combined.

- **Themes & Colors** - Switch between light and dark themes to match your preference and lighting conditions. Choose from a curated color palette or let the app automatically match colors with the anime visuals.
